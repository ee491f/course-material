Academia typically rewards a student that works alone and just turns in work by a deadline without any help from others. In the real world, it is better to update your team as you are progressing through your part of the group task, whether you are encountering obstacles or moving along smoothly. It is sometimes more worrying for a project manager when a team member is not bringing up issues, because that seldom happens in real life. A good project manager will create an environment where there is no judgment based on status updates and instead emphasize status updates as a way for the team to help one another through each other's obstacles and hence, leverages each of the team member's unique talents, skills, and gifts.</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Proactiveness</b><br>e.g. reaching out for help when stuck, trying different ways to find a solution, continual progress, etc.<br>One of the things that differentiates a junior from a senior team member is knowing when to give up and ask for help. My rule of thumb when starting out on something totally new and foreign is to err on the side of asking for help rather than continuously banging your head on a problem.<br>This quote formalizes this concept but applies it more generally.<blockquote>...The wisdow to know the difference.<cite><a href='https://assets.passiton.com/quotes/quote_artwork/6503/original/20180615_friday_quote.jpg?1528650342'>Reinhold Niebuhr</a></cite></blockquote></td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Project</b><br>At the end of the day, companies need to deliver and ship their products. If they don't, then they will be out of business. There will always need to be a balance between learning and delivering when you work on any project. This is yet another skill to that needs to be developed. These are some things can keep a project from succeeding:<br><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering'>over-engineering</a><br><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating_(project_management)'>gold-plating</a></td><td>80%</td></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td>Total</td><td>100%</td></tr></tfoot></table><table class='table-bordered hover'><caption>Final Grade</caption><thead><tr><th>Average</th><th>Grade</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>85% or greater</td><td>A or better</td></tr><tr><td>70% or greater</td><td>B or better</td></tr><tr><td>55% or greater</td><td>C or better</td></tr><tr><td>40% or greater</td><td>D or better</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>The +/- grading system will be used in this course.</li><li>Grade boundaries will be set to whole numbers (e.g. 82 not 82.3)</li><li>Precision and rounding will be handled by&nbsp;<a href='https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal'>Laulima</a></li></ul></section>
<section data-magellan-target='project' id='project'><h2>Project</h2><p>The goal of this course is for every student or team of students to build a web application that interacts with data and is accessible by anyone on the Internet. All of the exercises at the beginning of the course is aimed at teaching you the tools and technologies needed to accomplish deploying your project on to the Internet.</p><section data-magellan-target='requirements' id='requirements'><h3>Requirements</h3><p>Students and student teams can choose a project that they are most interested in. If you have an idea you always wanted to build or would like to see available to the world, those will make the best projects.</p><p>The project you decide to build must meet these requirements:</p><ul><li>The project shall be accessible on the Internet.</li><li>Any user shall be able to interact with the project without doing a lot of setup.<ul><li>For example, a user should be able to interact with your project using only their web browser.</li></ul></li><li>The project shall be dynamic and not static.<ul><li>For example, the project cannot be a static website, like the one you are reading. Data needs to be able to change without the code changing and the website will change to reflect the updated data.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Web applications lend itself to these requirements extremely well. Anyone with a web browser and Internet access can interact with the project. However, if there is a project you want to build that does not meet these requirements, please propose it and we can work together to make it fit this course.</p></section><section data-magellan-target='rubric' id='rubric'><h3>Rubric</h3><p>The project will consist of these phases:</p><ol><li>Project proposal and team forming<ul><li>This is when you decide what to work on and who to work with.</li><li>Pick a medium to share your idea with others.<ul><li>It can be a video of you presenting your idea.</li><li>It can be a short write up of your idea.</li></ul></li><li>You can build the project by yourself if you want.</li></ul></li><li>Project Mid Review<ul><li>Your project should be live on the Internet and accessible by any user.</li><li>This is when you get instructor feedback on your project.</li><li>Points will be given as if it was the final review so you know where your project stands in terms of grade.<ul><li>If the course ended now and you had to submit your project as-is, what would your final score be.</li></ul></li><li>This will give you an idea of where you stand and what you need to focus on for the final stretch of the course.</li></ul></li><li>Project Final Review<ul><li>Your project should be live on the Internet and accessible by any user.</li><li>You should have a video demonstration of your project.<ul><li>This can be a screencast or just a video recorded from your phone.</li><li>This video should go through what your project is and how a typical user would use it.</li></ul></li><li>Project will be graded and grades will be turned into Laulima.</li></ul></li></ol><p>The points given for the project is detailed in the table below.</p><table class='table-bordered hover'><caption>Point Allocation</caption><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Point</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Accessible on Internet</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>Functional (can create, read, update, and delete data)</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>User Interface (easy to navigate, appealing appearance, navigation menu/links, etc.)</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>User Accounts (authentication and authorization)</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/general-coding-philosophies-8482df17249b'>Code Metrics (e.g. Test Coverage, Documentation Coverage, Code Style Linting, self-documenting code, appropriate comments, security scanning, static code analysis, etc.)</a></td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Uniqueness (graphs/charts of data, complex backend algorithm, a feature that can be highlighted and sold as different from other projects, etc.)</td><td>10%</td></tr></tbody></table></section></section>
<section data-magellan-target='development-environment' id='development-environment'><h2>Development Environment</h2><p>A&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Development'>development environment</a>&nbsp;is where we will be developing (i.e. building) our project. For this course, your development environment will, at a minimum, require&nbsp;<a href='#git'>Git</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='#containers'>Docker containers</a>.&nbsp;Other requirements will be added depending on your project.</p><p><a href='#git'>Git</a>&nbsp;is how we manage our application's code, which controls our application.&nbsp;<a href='#containers'>Docker containers</a>&nbsp;is how we manage our application's dependencies, e.g. libraries, operating system packages, and other environment requirements.&nbsp;With these two tools, we can control our application and its environment. Being able to control your application and its environment allows any developer, teammate, or instructor to pull up your project on their own development environment. This can be useful if you need help troubleshooting or to get feedback on a feature you are developing. Having the application and its environment controlled avoids the age-old problem of "<a href='https://www.leadingagile.com/2017/03/works-on-my-machine/'>it works on my machine</a>".</p><p><a href='#git'>Git</a>&nbsp;can be installed on any operating system, but&nbsp;<a href='#containers'>docker containers</a>&nbsp;has more support for Linux based operating systems.&nbsp;<a href='https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DockerAndLinuxContainersOnWindowsWithOrWithoutHyperVVirtualMachines.aspx'>Windows support</a>&nbsp;is growing, but until containers on Windows and Linux works seamlessly together, this course will use Linux containers for grading.</p><h3>Development Environment Recommendations</h3><p>You can set up your development environment anyway you choose as long as it supports Git and containers. If you do not have a preference, then the following recommendations are good starting points:</p><ul><li><p>Linux Operating System: containers will run natively on your machine's operating system. You can use any flavor of Linux that is supported by Docker, but if you have no preference, then the easiest distribution to start learning on is&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a>.</p></li><li><p>Mac Operating System: containers can run on Apple deskop and laptops with&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/docker-mac'>Docker for Mac</a>.&nbsp;This is the setup I work with on a day-to-day basic, so it will be the easiest for me to lend a hand with this setup.</p></li><li><p>Windows Operating System: there is a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/docker-windows'>Docker for Windows</a>, but my experience with it is limited. My recommendation is to install&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a>&nbsp;as a virtual machine inside your Windows machine. You can use&nbsp;<a href='https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads'>Virtual Box</a>&nbsp;to manage the Ubuntu virtual machine. To summarize, your host machine will be Windows and your guest virtual machine will be Ubuntu.</p></li></ul></section>
<section data-magellan-target='version-control-system' id='version-control-system'><h2>Version Control System</h2><p>A&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control'>version control system</a>&nbsp;is a tool that allows you to track the changes to your source code.  If you've ever backed up your program and saved it to a folder with a timestamp then you've been manually controlling the changes (i.e. versions) of your program. A version control system will help you track those changes (i.e. versions) automagically.</p></section>

<section data-magellan-target='containers' id='containers'><h2>Containers</h2><p><a href='https://www.docker.com/what-container'>Container technology</a>&nbsp;allows you to keep your application and dependencies isolated from other applications. Another way to look at it is that containers help you manage your application and its dependencies.</p><p>Every application is comprised of its application code (source code) and its dependencies' code (environment). If we are able know exactly what changed with the source code and the environment, then we should have total control of the application, which will help us track down why the application is not behaving as we expect it to.</p><p>With a&nbsp;<a href='#version-control-system'>version control system</a>&nbsp;we have complete control of the source code. With containers, we have complete control of the environment. Using these two tools together, we will have complete control of everything an application needs to work properly. This also means we should be able to know exactly what changed with the source code/environment and what needs to be fixed.</p><p>The only things that are out of our control is the networking and hardware, which this class will not focus on.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='docker' id='docker'><h2>Docker</h2><p>The container platform we will be using for this class is&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/what-docker'>Docker</a>, because it is popular and has a rich ecosystem of tools surrounding it. Please&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/install/'>install docker</a>&nbsp;on your development environment. Please install the free community edition.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='docker-compose' id='docker-compose'><h2>Docker-Compose</h2><p><a href='https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/'>Docker-compose</a>&nbsp;is a tool to help us stitch containers together. It also makes it easier to interact with docker through configuration files. Using just docker alone will require using command line arguments. The benefit of using configuration files over command line arguments is that configuration files can easily be source controlled and shared with other developers as well as being more&nbsp;<a href='http://amzotti.github.io/programming%20paradigms/2015/02/13/what-is-the-difference-between-procedural-function-imperative-and-declarative-programming-paradigms/'>declarative instead of imperative</a>.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/'>install docker-compose</a>&nbsp;on your development environment.</p><p>Read these tutorials to understand how to use docker-compose:</p><ol><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/how-to-understand-pulling-images-with-docker-compose-236e323e541'>docker-compose pull</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/how-to-understand-running-containers-with-docker-compose-a8160b487a98'>docker-compose up (and docker-compose down)</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/how-to-understand-building-images-with-docker-compose-24cbdbc0641f'>docker-compose build</a></li></ol><p>The above tutorials (and its respective docker-compose commands) will allow you to work with containers on your own machine. This is already hugely beneficial because the application container is isolated from your host machine so you do not have to worry about artifacts from your application spilling out into your development machine (e.g. the host machine) and you do not have to worry about artifacts from your development machine (e.g. the host machine) spilling into your application. You now have full control of your application and its environment.</p><p>Docker-Compose wraps around Docker so everything docker-compose is doing, you can do the same thing manually with docker and its associated&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/'>command line arguments</a>.&nbsp;Using docker-compose is a bit easier and requires less typing, but there will be times when you might need to dive deeper into docker and the capabilities docker provides, which might not be provided by docker-compose.

<section data-magellan-target='postgresql-exercises' id='postgresql-exercises'><h2>PostgreSQL Exercises</h2><p>For these exercises, we will play around with PostgreSQL using SQL and Python. People who work primarily with databases (aka database administrators) will normally use SQL, but (web) application developers will normally use an&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping'>object relational mapping</a>&nbsp;library to interact with the PostgreSQL database. ORMs allow developers to work with a database using the application's programming language (e.g. Python in our case).</p><p>Django's ORM library is the engine/library that allows you and your application to interact with the database thru Django's&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/db/'>models</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_orm/'>QuerySets</a>.

<section data-magellan-target='production' id='production'><h2>Production</h2><p>Thus far, we have developed and used things that are only accessible by us on our own development machine. At some point, in order for other users to utilize what you have built, you need to&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment'>deploy</a>&nbsp;your application to a&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Production'>production environment</a>&nbsp;for others to access. The web is a great way to distribute your application to others and the simple web applications you've made can be deployed to web servers for anyone with Internet access to access.</p><p>There is a whole field dedicated to taking an application to production. It is called&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps'>developer operations (devops)</a>.</p><p>The focus of this course is developing an application, not deploying one. But it is extremely gratifying to see your application deployed and see how the code that you write can eventually be used by anyone the world. So to keep you focused on developing your application, but still give you the benefit of seeing your application deployed, we will use a free and relatively easy to use service to help deploy your application.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='heroku' id='heroku'><h2>Heroku</h2><p><a href='https://www.heroku.com/'>Heroku</a>&nbsp;is a commercial service that deploys and&nbsp;<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43452540/where-are-heroku-apps-hosted-exactly/45229837'>hosts</a>&nbsp;applications. It is essentially a devops team for hire. We will use Heroku to deploy our application because it is free and relatively easy to use.</p><p>By using Heroku, you will get a sense for what devops is trying to accomplish, which is to make deploying your application be as simple, automated, and reliable as possible.</p><p>Heroku is able to deploy web application written in&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/'>many different languages</a>.&nbsp;For our class, we will leverage Heroku's ability to deploy containers to help deploy our containerized application:</p><ul><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime'>how to use Heroku to deploy containers</a></li></ul><p>There are other options for us to use to deploy our Django application, like using Heroku's Python buildpack:</p><ul><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python'>overview of deploying Django on Heroku</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python'>step-by-step instructions on deploying a Django app on Heroku</a></li></ul><p>There are even more options to deploy applications outside of Heroku, but those are outside the scope of this course. This course arbitrarily chose Heroku because it is free and relatively simple. The course material is written to support using Heroku's container deployment feature because learning to deploy a container will offer more flexibility to the developer in the future. Using Heroku's Python buildpack is probably simpler, but might be more limiting in terms of future growth. However, students can choose whichever deployment process s/he prefers as long as the web application is hosted and accessible by the instructor via a web browser with an Internet connection. This can include deployment services outside of Heroku.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='heroku-exercises' id='heroku-exercises'><h2>Heroku Exercises</h2><p>For these exercises, we will practice using Heroku's deployment and hosting service.</p><p>Follow the Heroku's documentation&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/'>here</a> to:</p><ul><li><a href='https://signup.heroku.com/dc'>create a free account</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli'>install their command line interface (cli)</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git'>understand the Git workflow you need to follow to use their service</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python'>deploy Heroku's sample django application</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime'>deploy an application container</a></li></ul><p>There are multiple ways to&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment'>deploy</a> an application to Heroku. After completing these exercises, you have learned to deploy using Heroku's&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-git'>Git/Buildpack</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-docker'>Docker/container</a>&nbsp;method.</p><p>The recommended deployment approach for this class is to use the Docker container method. The reason is because the industry as a whole is moving towards using containers and learning this approach will be more beneficial to you in the long run. However, whichever method you use will have no effect on your course grade.</p><p>The main objective is to be able to consistently and repeatably deploy your application so your users, which in this course, will be the instructor and possibly a few of your classmates, can access the latest version of your application.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='next-steps' id='next-steps'><h2>Where To Go From Here</h2><p>In this course, you have built a web application using the Django framework and deployed the application on to the Internet using Heroku.</p><p>The web application you have built uses an architecture that is a bit outdated. However, it is simplest in terms of learning and getting started. That is the reason why it was chosen.</p><p>If you enjoyed building a web application, then you can consider splitting up the Django appliation to a separate&nbsp;<a href='https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/#front-ends'>frontend application</a>&nbsp;(e.g. VueJS, ReactJS, etc.) and a separate backend application (i.e. use Django as just a REST API server). Most modern web applications are structured in this manner. With a separate backend service (e.g. REST API server), the application can support multiple frontends (e.g. web browser, mobile app, etc.).</p><p>If you enjoyed stitching the different containers and services together, then you can consider looking into doing more devops (e.g. continuous integration and continuous deployment, the service Heroku provides), infrastructure (e.g. cloud), or architecture (e.g. microservices, high-level system overview).</p><p>Choose what you enjoy and you won't go wrong. If you don't know what you enjoy yet, then try a bit of each and see which one&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvWs2X-bEA'>sparks joy</a>&nbsp;for you.</p><p>Good luck to you and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHWUCX6osgM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1289'>stay hungry, stay foolish</a>.</p></section>
