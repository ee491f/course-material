Policy</h3><table class='table-bordered unstriped hover'><caption>Grading Breakdown</caption><thead><tr><th></th><th>Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Exercises</b><br>These exercises are a chance to make try new and different things, make mistakes, and <b>learn from failures</b>.&nbsp;Nobody is expected to get all of the exercises correctly by themselves without any help.&nbsp;<br><u>Communicate</u>&nbsp;your progress with timely updates and give transparency into your work so others can learn from you as well as better help you when they have insight into your work.&nbsp;<br>This is something that is really important in the real work place, but is not emphasized enough in academia.&nbsp;Academia typically rewards a student that works alone and just turns in work by a deadline without any help from others.&nbsp;In the real world, it is better to update your team as you are progressing through your part of the group task, whether you are encountering obstacles or moving along smoothly.&nbsp;It is sometimes more worrying for a project manager when a team member is not bringing up issues, because that seldom happens in real life.&nbsp;A good project manager will create an environment where there is no judgment based on status updates and instead emphasize status updates as a way for the team to help one another through each other's obstacles and hence,&nbsp;leverages each of the team member's unique talents, skills, and gifts.<br><u>Be Proactive</u>&nbsp;in trying different ways to find a solution to a problem, but also remembering to reach out for help when you are stuck so you can continue to make progress.<br>One of the things that differentiates a junior from a senior team member is knowing when to give up and ask for help.&nbsp;My rule of thumb when starting out on something totally new and foreign is to err on the side of asking for help rather than continuously banging your head on a problem.<br>This quote, called the&nbsp;<i>Serenity Prayer</i>, formalizes this concept but applies it more generally.<blockquote>Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.<cite><a href='https://assets.passiton.com/quotes/quote_artwork/6503/original/20180615_friday_quote.jpg?1528650342'>Reinhold Niebuhr</a></cite></blockquote></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Project</b><br>At the end of the day, companies need to <b>deliver</b> and ship their products.&nbsp;If they don't, then they will be out of business.&nbsp;There will always need to be a balance between learning and delivering when you work on any project.&nbsp;This is yet another skill that is not developed within acadamia.&nbsp;These are some things can keep a project from succeeding:<br><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering'>over-engineering</a><br><a

phase is where the instructor will introduce material and the student will practice it with exercise assignments</li><li><b>Project</b>: this phase is where the student will apply all of the topics learned to produce a data driven web application</li></ul><p>During the Learning and Exercises phase, the course will try to <b>blend in project management ideas</b> from Agile/Scrum/Extreme-Programming philosophies/frameworks into an academia setting.&nbsp;This might be a bit foreign, but please keep an <b>open mind</b>.</p><ul><li><b><a href='https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/'>Daily Stand-Up</a></b>&nbsp;will consist of each student giving a brief update addressing the following questions:<ul><li><b>What did you accomplish yesterday?</b></li><li><b>What do you plan to accomplish today?</b></li><li><b>Are there any questions, concerns, or anything blocking you from progressing?</b></li></ul>The main focus of stand-up is to <b>communicate questions, concerns,&nbsp;or any potential blockers</b> that might be easily fixed with the help of&nbsp;your team, which in this case is the rest of the class.&nbsp;Many students will encounter very similar problems and depending on the&nbsp;complexity and the number of students affected, we can triage and decide&nbsp;on one of the following options:<ul><li>Address issue after stand up (this allows everyone a chance to bring up blockers before any particular blocker is addressed)</li><li>Address issue after class (aka office hours)</li></ul>In a normal working environment, team members that is not affected or cannot contribute to a blocker can then be free to go off and work on their own tasks.</li><li><b>Assignments</b> are described and tracked as project tasks within our&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/orgs/ee491f/projects'>GitHub Project</a>.&nbsp;They are turned in using&nbsp;<a href='https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal'>Laulima</a>.&nbsp;For most assignments, you will be submitting a link to your code, or more precisely, a link to your Git repository with your code.</li><li>We will occassionally perform a&nbsp;<b><a href='https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Agile-retrospective'>retrospection</a></b>&nbsp;to discuss these topics:<ul><li><b>What is working well for the class?</b></li><li><b>What can be improved for the class?</b></li><li><b>What should we implement going forward?</b></li></ul>The main focus of retrospection is to iteratively <b>improve</b> a team's process, which in this case is our class process.&nbsp;It is similar to the survey at the end of the course, except that the students' feedback can be implemented while they are still in the course.</li><li>Daily Stand Up's and Retrospection's are about the only Agile/Scrum/Extreme-Programming ceremonies that I can think of that can be useful in this classroom scenario.&nbsp;If you can think of ways of incorporating other Agile/Scrum/Extreme-Programming ceremonies (e.g. demonstration, sprint/iteration planning &amp; closing) into the course, please let me know and I would be happy to try it out.</li></ul><p>During the Project phase, the course will try to resemble more of a hackathon,&nbsp;where we will spend the class time working on our separate projects together and helping each other overcome bugs and other blockers.</p>

<section data-magellan-target='development-environment' id='development-environment'><h2>Development Environment</h2><p>A&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Development'>development environment</a>&nbsp;is where we will be developing (i.e. building) our project. For this course, your development environment will, at a minimum, require&nbsp;<a href='#git'>Git</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='#containers'>Docker containers</a>.&nbsp;Other requirements will be added depending on your project.</p><p><a href='#git'>Git</a>&nbsp;is how we manage our application's code, which controls our application.&nbsp;<a href='#containers'>Docker containers</a>&nbsp;is how we manage our application's dependencies, e.g. libraries, operating system packages, and other environment requirements.&nbsp;With these two tools, we can control our application and its environment. Being able to control your application and its environment allows any developer, teammate, or instructor to pull up your project on their own development environment. This can be useful if you need help troubleshooting or to get feedback on a feature you are developing. Having the application and its environment controlled avoids the age-old problem of "<a href='https://www.leadingagile.com/2017/03/works-on-my-machine/'>it works on my machine</a>".</p><h3>Development Environment Recommendations</h3><p>You can set up your development environment anyway you choose as long as it supports Git and containers.&nbsp;If you do not have a preference, then the following recommendations are good starting points:</p><ul><li><p>Linux Operating System: containers will run natively on your machine's operating system. You can use any flavor of Linux that is supported by Docker, but if you have no preference, then the easiest distribution to start learning on is&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a>.</p></li><li><p>Mac Operating System: containers can run on Apple deskop and laptops with&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/docker-mac'>Docker for Mac</a>.&nbsp;This is the setup I work with on a day-to-day basis, so it will be the easiest for me to lend a hand with this setup.</p></li><li><p>Windows Operating System: containers can run on Windows deskop and laptops with&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/docker-windows'>Docker for Windows</a>, but I do not use it on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;However, I have tried it out and helped my co-workers with it at a minimal level, so I can help with some parts of this set up.<br>Installing Docker for Windows is not as straight forward as the Linux/Mac setup.&nbsp;<br>These guides should help:<ul><li>Installing Docker for Windows:&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/'>https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/</a></li><li>Installing Docker for Windows' dependency, WSL2:&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/'>https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/</a></li></ul>If you cannot get Docker for Windows working, then you also have the option of installing&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a>&nbsp;as a virtual machine inside your Windows machine. You can use&nbsp;<a href='https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads'>Virtual Box</a>&nbsp;to manage the Ubuntu virtual machine. To summarize the alternative option: your host machine will be Windows and your guest virtual machine will be Ubuntu.</p></li></ul><p>The last thing you need in your development environment is something to write code with.&nbsp;You can use a&nbsp;<a href='https://discuss.atom.io/t/what-is-the-difference-between-an-ide-and-an-editor/32629'>basic editor or an integrated development environment (IDE)</a>.</p><p>For our class demonstrations, I will be using&nbsp;<a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/'>Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a>.&nbsp;If you are unfamiliar with editors and IDEs, then I would recommend using the same tooling as the class demonstrations, e.g. VS Code.&nbsp;VS Code is supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows.&nbsp;It is free, being actively developed, and very popular in the community.&nbsp;However, if you prefer a particular editor or IDE, then please feel free to continue using whatever you are comfortable with.&nbsp;Just be sure you can use Git and containers with whatever you decide to use.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='version-control-system' id='version-control-system'><h2>Version Control System</h2><p>A&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control'>version control system</a>&nbsp;is a tool that allows you to track the changes to your source code.  If you've ever backed up your program and saved it to a folder with a timestamp then you've been manually controlling the changes (i.e. versions) of your program. A version control system will help you track those changes (i.e. versions) automagically.</p></section>

Another way to look at it is that containers help you manage your application and its dependencies.</p><p>Every application is comprised of its application code (source code) and its dependencies' code (environment).

<section data-magellan-target='docker' id='docker'><h2>Docker</h2><p>The container platform we will be using for this class is&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/what-docker'>Docker</a>, because it is popular and has a rich ecosystem of tools surrounding it.

The benefit of using configuration files over command line arguments is that configuration files can easily be source controlled and shared with other developers as well as being more&nbsp;<a href='http://amzotti.github.io/programming%20paradigms/2015/02/13/what-is-the-difference-between-procedural-function-imperative-and-declarative-programming-paradigms/'>declarative instead of imperative</a>.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/'>install Docker-Compose</a>&nbsp;on your development environment.</p><p>Read these tutorials to understand how to use Docker-Compose:</p><ol><li><a href='https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-understand-downloading-images-with-docker-compose-236e323e541?sk=0b655a4c4d22e33f1f856ebe507e678e'>docker-compose pull</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-understand-running-containers-with-docker-compose-a8160b487a98?sk=d8237da6d6cd9b4353219e156244b51f'>docker-compose up (and docker-compose down)</a></li><li><a href='https://zhao-li.medium.com/how-to-understand-building-images-with-docker-compose-24cbdbc0641f?sk=03f98f17c8902323dd82dd553b7d0d3a'>docker-compose build</a></li></ol><p>The above tutorials (and its respective Docker-Compose commands) will allow you to work with containers on your own machine. This is already hugely beneficial because the application container is isolated from your host machine so you do not have to worry about artifacts from your application spilling out into your development machine (e.g. the host machine) and you do not have to worry about artifacts from your development machine (e.g. the host machine) spilling into your application.

<section data-magellan-target='production' id='production'><h2>Production</h2><p>Thus far, we have developed and used things that are only accessible by us on our own development machine. At some point, in order for other users to utilize what you have built, you need to&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment'>deploy</a>&nbsp;your application to a&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Production'>production environment</a>&nbsp;for others to access. The web is a great way to distribute your application to others and the simple web applications you've made can be deployed to web servers for anyone with Internet access to use.</p><p>There is a whole field dedicated to taking an application to production. It is called&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps'>developer operations (devops)</a>.</p><p>The focus of this course is developing an application, not deploying one. But it is extremely gratifying to see your application deployed and see how the code that you write can eventually be used by anyone in the world. So to keep you focused on developing your application, but still give you the benefit of seeing your application deployed, we will use a free and relatively easy to use service to help deploy your application.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='heroku' id='heroku'><h2>Heroku</h2><p><a href='https://www.heroku.com/'>Heroku</a>&nbsp;is a commercial service that deploys and&nbsp;<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43452540/where-are-heroku-apps-hosted-exactly/45229837'>hosts</a>&nbsp;applications. It is essentially a devops team for hire. We will use Heroku to deploy our application because it is free and relatively easy to use.</p><p>By using Heroku, you will get a sense for what devops is trying to accomplish, which is to make deploying your application be as simple, automated, and reliable as possible.</p><p>Heroku is able to deploy web application written in&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/'>many different languages</a>.&nbsp;For our class, we will leverage Heroku's ability to deploy containers to help deploy our containerized application:</p><ul><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime'>how to use Heroku to deploy containers</a></li></ul><p>If you have extra time and would like to go beyond the scope of this course, check out this other way of deploying on Heroku, using Heroku's Python buildpack:</p><ul><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python'>overview of deploying Django on Heroku</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python'>step-by-step instructions on deploying a Django app on Heroku</a></li></ul><p>There are even more options to deploy applications outside of Heroku, but those are also outside the scope of this course. This course arbitrarily chose Heroku because it is free and relatively simple. The course material is written to support using Heroku's container deployment feature because learning to deploy a container will offer more flexibility to the developer in the future. Using Heroku's Python buildpack is probably simpler, but might be more limiting in terms of future growth. However, students can choose whichever deployment process s/he prefers as long as the web application is hosted and accessible by the instructor via a web browser with an Internet connection. This can include deployment services outside of Heroku, if that is the student's preference. Be advised, that the instructor may be unfamiliar with other services and, hence, may only be able to provide limited support should there be issues using the service.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='heroku-exercises' id='heroku-exercises'><h2>Heroku Exercises</h2><p>For these exercises, we will practice using Heroku's deployment and hosting service.</p><p>Follow&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/'>Heroku's tutorials&nbsp;</a>to:</p><ul><li><a href='https://signup.heroku.com/'>create a free account</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli'>install their command line interface (cli)</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime'>deploy your Django application container</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-app-configuration'>modify Django application to work with Heroku</a></li><li><a href='https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#databases'>integrate PostgreSQL with Django application</a></li></ul><p>There are multiple ways to&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment'>deploy</a> an application to Heroku. After completing the above exercises, you have learned to deploy using Heroku's&nbsp;<a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-docker'>Docker/container</a>&nbsp;method.</p><p>If you extra time and would like to go beyond the scope of this course, go through the other way of deploying on Heroku, using Heroku's Python buildpack via Git:</p><ul><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git'>understand the Git workflow you need to follow to use their service</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-git'>Git/Buildpack</a></li><li><a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python'>deploy Heroku's sample django application</a></li></ul><p>The recommended deployment approach for this class is to use the Docker container method. The reason is because the industry as a whole is moving towards using containers and learning this approach will be more beneficial to you in the long run. However, whichever method you use will have no effect on your course grade.</p><p>The main objective is to be able to consistently and repeatably deploy your application so your users, which in this course will be the instructor and possibly a few of your classmates, can access the latest version of your application.</p></section>

That is the reason why it was chosen.</p><p>If you enjoyed building a web application, then you can consider splitting up the Django appliation to a separate&nbsp;<a href='https://www.gurutechnolabs.com/top-front-end-frameworks/'>frontend application</a>&nbsp;(e.g. VueJS, ReactJS, etc.; I've been liking VueJS recently) and a separate backend application (i.e. use Django as just a REST API server).&nbsp;Most modern web applications are structured in this manner.&nbsp;With a separate backend service (e.g. REST API server), the application can support multiple frontends (e.g. web browser, mobile app, etc.).</p><p>Most application developers tend to gravitate towards either being a frontend developer or a backend developer.&nbsp;If graphics and user interfaces spark joy for you, then look into the frontend ecosystem.&nbsp;If data, automation, and the abstract sparks joy for you, then look into the backend ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>If you enjoyed stitching the different containers and services together,&nbsp;then you can consider looking into doing more devops&nbsp;(e.g. continuous integration and continuous deployment, the service Heroku provides),&nbsp;infrastructure (e.g. cloud), or architecture (e.g. microservices, high-level system overview).</p><p>You can use these&nbsp;<a href='https://roadmap.sh/'>roadmaps</a>&nbsp;to help you gain a better understanding of the landscape of each specialty (e.g. frontend, backend, devops, etc.).&nbsp;You can also use the roadmaps to help guide you to the next topics to learn and explore.&nbsp;</p><p>Choose what you enjoy and you won't go wrong. If you don't know what you enjoy yet, then try a bit of each and see which one&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvWs2X-bEA'>sparks joy</a>&nbsp;for you.</p><p>Good luck to you and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHWUCX6osgM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1289'>stay hungry, stay foolish</a>.</p></section>
