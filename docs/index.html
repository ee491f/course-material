<section data-magellan-target='project' id='project'><h2>Project</h2><p>The goal of this course is for every student or team of students to build a web application that interacts with data and is accessible by anyone on the Internet. All of the exercises at the beginning of the course is aimed at teaching you the tools and technologies needed to accomplish deploying your project on to the Internet.</p><section data-magellan-target='requirements' id='requirements'><h3>Requirements</h3><p>Students and student teams can choose a project that they are most interested in. If you have an idea you always wanted to build or would like to see available to the world, those will make the best projects.</p><p>The project you decide to build must meet these requirements:</p><ul><li>The project shall be accessible on the Internet.</li><li>Any user shall be able to interact with the project without doing a lot of setup.<ul><li>For example, a user should be able to interact with your project using only their web browser.</li></ul></li><li>The project shall be dynamic and not static.<ul><li>For example, the project cannot be a static website, like the one you are reading. Data needs to be able to change without the code changing and the website will change to reflect the updated data.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Web applications lend itself to these requirements extremely well. Anyone with a web browser and Internet access can interact with the project. However, if there is a project you want to build that does not meet these requirements, please propose it and we can work together to make it fit this course.</p></section><section data-magellan-target='rubric' id='rubric'><h3>Rubric</h3><p>The points given for the project will fall into 2 categories, product evaluation (what is built) and project execution (how it is built). Every project needs to be balanced between how good the product is and how fast the product is built.</p><p>The project will consist of these phases:</p><ol><li>Project proposal and team forming<ul><li>This is when you decide what to work on and who to work with.</li><li>Pick a medium to share your idea with others.<ul><li>It can be a video of you presenting your idea.</li><li>It can be a short write up of your idea.</li></ul></li><li>You can build the project by yourself if you want.</li></ul></li><li>Project Mid Review<ul><li>Your project should be live on the Internet and accessible by any user.</li><li>This is when you get instructor feedback on your project.</li><li>Points will be given as if it was the final review so you know where your project stands in terms of grade.<ul><li>If the course ended now and you had to submit your project as-is, what would your final score be.</li></ul></li><li>This will give you an idea of where you stand and what you need to focus on for the final stretch of the course.</li></ul></li><li>Project Final Review<ul><li>Your project should be live on the Internet and accessible by any user.</li><li>You should have a video demonstration of your project.<ul><li>This can be a screencast or just a video recorded from your phone.</li><li>This video should go through what your project is and how a typical user would use it.</li></ul></li><li>Project will be graded and grades will be turned into Laulima.</li></ul></li></ol></section></section>
<section data-magellan-target='development-environment' id='development-environment'><h2>Development Environment</h2><p>A&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Development'>development environment</a>&nbsp;is where we will be developing (i.e. building) our project. For this course, your development environment will, at a minimum, require&nbsp;<a href='#git'>Git</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='#containers'>Docker containers</a>.&nbsp;Other requirements will be added depending on your project.</p><p><a href='#git'>Git</a>&nbsp;is how we manage our application's code, which controls our application.&nbsp;<a href='#containers'>Docker containers</a>&nbsp;is how we manage our application's dependencies, e.g. libraries, operating system packages, and other environment requirements.&nbsp;With these two tools, we can control our application and its environment. Being able to control your application and its environment allows any developer, teammate, or instructor to pull up your project on their own development environment. This can be useful if you need help troubleshooting or to get feedback on a feature you are developing. Having the application and its environment controlled avoids the age-old problem of "<a href='https://www.leadingagile.com/2017/03/works-on-my-machine/'>it works on my machine</a>".</p><p><a href='#git'>Git</a>&nbsp;can be installed on any operating system, but&nbsp;<a href='#containers'>docker containers</a>&nbsp;has more support for Linux based operating systems.&nbsp;<a href='https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DockerAndLinuxContainersOnWindowsWithOrWithoutHyperVVirtualMachines.aspx'>Windows support</a>&nbsp;is growing, but until containers on Windows and Linux works seamlessly together, this course will use Linux containers for grading.</p><h3>Development Environment Recommendations</h3><p>You can set up your development environment anyway you choose as long as it supports Git and containers. If you do not have a preference, then the following recommendations are good starting points:</p><ul><li><p>Linux Operating System: containers will run natively on your machine's operating system. You can use any flavor of Linux that is supported by Docker, but if you have no preference, then the easiest distribution to start learning on is&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a>.</p></li><li><p>Mac Operating System: containers can run on Apple deskop and laptops with&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/docker-mac'>Docker for Mac</a>.&nbsp;This is the setup I work with on a day-to-day basic, so it will be the easiest for me to lend a hand with this setup.</p></li><li><p>Windows Operating System: there is a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/docker-windows'>Docker for Windows</a>, but my experience with it is limited and my initial experiments with it has been disappointing. My recommendation is to install&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a>&nbsp;as a virtual machine inside your Windows machine. You can use&nbsp;<a href='https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads'>Virtual Box</a>&nbsp;to manage the Ubuntu virtual machine. To summarize, your host machine will be Windows and your guest virtual machine will be Ubuntu.</p></li></ul></section>
<section data-magellan-target='version-control-system' id='version-control-system'><h2>Version Control System</h2><p>A&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control'>version control system</a>&nbsp;is a tool that allows you to track the changes to your source code.  If you've ever backed up your program and saved it to a folder with a timestamp then you've been manually controlling the changes (i.e. versions) of your program. A version control system will help you track those changes (i.e. versions) automagically.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='git' id='git'><h2>Git</h2><p>The version control system we will be using for this class is&nbsp;<a href='https://git-scm.com/'>Git</a>.&nbsp;Git is the&nbsp;<a href='https://rhodecode.com/insights/version-control-systems-2016'>most popular</a>&nbsp;and has a lot of supporting services. You will need Git for this course, so please&nbsp;<a href='https://git-scm.com/downloads'>download</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git'>install</a>&nbsp;Git before getting started with the Git exercises.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='github' id='github'><h2>GitHub</h2><p><a href='https://github.com/'>Github</a>&nbsp;is one of those services that support Git.Github allows users to share the code they version control with Git. There are&nbsp;<a href='https://medium.com/flow-ci/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-gitlab-vs-coding-7cf2b43888a1'>other services</a>&nbsp;that compete with Github, but a lot of open source projects use Github so that is the one we will be using for this class. You will need a Github account for this course, so please sign up for a free account&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/join'>here</a>.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='git-github-exercises' id='git-github-exercises'><h2>Git and Github Exercises</h2><p>These exercises will explain the fundatmentals of using Git and Github. Some exercises are designed to help you understand how the tools work; other exercises will give you a chance to see how you would use the tools to build your project.</p><p>Get familiar using these Git basic commands:</p><ol><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git init</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git status</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git add</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git commit</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git checkout</a></li></ol><p>The above commands will allow you to version control your project on your own machine. This is already hugely beneficial because it frees you from having to continually back up the code yourself. With the code committed, you can always get back to a known working state as well as seeing the difference between each commit (or saved state). The following exercise will give you a chance to see how the basic commands can be used together to allow you to save off your code, get back to it, and see what changed.</p><ul><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Commit (Save) and Checkout (Load)</a></li></ul><p>This course requires you to share your code to Github so it can be viewed and graded. So the next commands will allow you to share the code from your machine to a remote git repository, which for our class will be Github.</p><ol><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git remote add</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git push</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git clone</a></li></ol><p>The above commands will allow you to syncronize your local repository (the code on your own machine) to the remote repository (the code on Github). Thus allowing you to share your code with others so they can see your code. The following exercise will walk you through the process of sharing your code.</p><ul><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Make Changes Locally and Push Changes to Github</a></li></ul><p>This course might require you to work in a team of developers so you will need to do more than share your code (i.e. allow others to see your code). You need to collaborate with others on your code (i.e. allow others to make changes to the team project code). To collaborate effectively, you and your teammates will need to use branches.</p><ol><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git branch</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>git merge --no-ff</a></li></ol><p>The above commands will allow you to collaborate with your teammates by allowing teammates to work on separate features and then contributing their features back to the project. The following exercise will walkthrough how to use branches as a team.</p><ul><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Branch Off, Create Feature, and Merge Feature</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Parallel Feature Branches</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Parallel Feature Branches with Conflicts</a></li></ul><p>The following exercise will give you a chance to practice everything you've learned about Git and Github.</p><ul><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Contribute Changes to Team Repository</a></li></ul></section>
<section data-magellan-target='containers' id='containers'><h2>Containers</h2><p>A&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/what-container'>container</a>&nbsp;is a tool that allows you to keep your application and dependencies isolated from other applications. Another way to look at it is that containers help you manage your application and its dependencies.</p><p>Every application is comprised of its application code (source code) and its dependencies' code (environment). If we are able know exactly what changed with the source code and the environment, then we should have total control of the application, which will help us track down why the application is not behaving as we expect it to.</p><p>With a&nbsp;<a href='#version-control-system'>version control system</a>&nbsp;we have complete control of the source code. With containers, we have complete control of the environment. Using these two tools together, we will have complete control of everything an application needs to work properly. This also means we should be able to know exactly what changed with the source code/environment and what needs to be fixed.</p><p>The only things that are out of our control is the networking and hardware, which this class will not focus on.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='docker' id='docker'><h2>Docker</h2><p>The container platform we will be using for this class is&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/what-docker'>Docker</a>, because it is popular and has a rich ecosystem of tools surrounding it. Please&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/install/'>install docker</a>&nbsp;on your development environment. Please install the free community edition.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='docker-compose' id='docker-compose'><h2>Docker-Compose</h2><p><a href='https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/'>Docker-compose</a>&nbsp;is a tool to help us stitch containers together. It also makes it easier to interact with docker through configuration files. Using just docker alone will require using command line arguments. The benefit of using configuration files over command line arguments is that configuration files can easily be source controlled and shared with other developers.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/'>install docker-compose</a>&nbsp;on your development environment.</p></section>
<section data-magellan-target='docker-compose-exercises' id='docker-compose-exercises'><h2>Docker-Compose Exercises</h2><p>These exercises will explain the fundatmentals of using Docker-Compose. Some exercises are designed to help you understand how the tool works; other exercises will give you a chance to see how you would use the tool to build your project. Docker-Compose wraps around Docker so everything docker-compose is doing, you can do the same thing manually with docker and its associated&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/'>command line arguments</a>.&nbsp;Using docker-compose is a bit easier and requires less typing, but there will be times when you might need to dive deeper into docker and the capabilities docker provides, which might not be provided by docker-compose. You can learn those docker commands as it is needed when you are troubleshooting.</p><p>Get familiar using these basic commands:</p><ol><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>docker-compose build</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>docker-compose up</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>docker-compose run</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>docker-compose down -v</a></li></ol><p>The above commands will allow you to work with containers on your own machine. This is already hugely beneficial because the application container is isolated from your host machine so you do not have to worry about artifacts from your application spilling out into your development machine and you do not have to worry about artifacts from your development machine spilling into your application. You now have full control of your application and its environment.</p><p>The following exercise will demonstrate some of the nuances of using containers.</p><ul><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Host Filesystem vs Container Filesystem</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Networking</a></li><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Volumes</a></li></ul><p>The following exercise will give you a chance to use everything you have learned to allow you to use containers that others have built.</p><ul><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Use Community Containers</a></li></ul><p>The following exercise will give you a chance to practice everything you've learned about Docker and Docker-Compose.</p><ul><li><a href='https://medium.com/@zhao.li/'>Create a Simple Program to Share with Others</a></li></ul></section>
