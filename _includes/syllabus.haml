    %li This course is designed to be a guide for the student as they find their way when building their own web application that is live on the Internet.
    %li This course goes through concepts and exercises that will teach the basic usages of tools that will help the student developer build their web application.
    %li This course is intended to help the student finish their project using project management ideas from industry that is tailored for the classroom setting.
    %li During the course, the course instructor will play a product manager role and the student developers will play the role of project manager and developers.
    %li This course aims to provide you with experiences and a product you can talk to interviewers with by putting you in a team environment so you can gain experience working with others and for a pseudo-manager.
    %li This course also moves away from the academia's built-in idea that someone will always have the answers to teach you. Instead it moves closer to the real-world where nobody knows the answer, but we are all going to figure it out together. In other words, there will be more guiding than teaching in this course.

          This is something that is really important in the real work place, but is not emphasized enough in academia. Academia typically rewards a student that works alone and just turns in work by a deadline without any help from others. In the real world, it is better to update your team as you are progressing through your part of the group task, whether you are encountering obstacles or moving along smoothly. It is sometimes more worrying for a project manager when a team member is not bringing up issues, because that seldom happens in real life. A good project manager will create an environment where there is no judgment based on status updates and instead emphasize status updates as a way for the team to help one another through each other's obstacles and hence, leverages each of the team member's unique talents, skills, and gifts.

          One of the things that differentiates a junior from a senior team member is knowing when to give up and ask for help. My rule of thumb when starting out on something totally new and foreign is to err on the side of asking for help rather than continuously banging your head on a problem.

          At the end of the day, companies need to deliver and ship their products. If they don't, then they will be out of business. There will always need to be a balance between learning and delivering when you work on any project. This is yet another skill to that needs to be developed. These are some things can keep a project from succeeding:

%h3 Course Progression
%p
  This course will try to blend in project management ideas from Agile/Scrum/Extreme-Programming philosophies/frameworks into an academia setting.&nbsp;
  This might be a bit foreign, but please keep an open mind.
%ul
  %li
    %a{href: 'https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/'} Daily Stand-Up
    &nbsp;will consist of each student giving a brief update addressing the following questions:
    %ul
      %li What did you accomplish yesterday?
      %li What do you plan to accomplish today?
      %li Are there anything blocking you from progressing?
    The main focus of stand-up is to communicate any potential blockers that might be easily fixed with the help of your team, which in this case is the rest of the class.&nbsp;
    Many students will encounter very similar problems and depending on the complexity and the number of students affected, we can triage and decide on one of the following options:
    %ul
      %li Address issue after stand up (this allows everyone a chance to bring up blockers before any particular blocker is addressed)
      %li Address issue after class (aka office hours)
    In a normal working environment, team members that is not affected or cannot contribute to a blocker can then be free to go off and work on their own tasks.
  %li
    Assignments are turned in via Laulima and will most likely be a link to your code, or more precisely, a link to a Git repository with your code.
  %li
    We will occassionally perform a&nbsp;
    %a{href: 'https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Agile-retrospective'} retrospection
    &nbsp;to discuss these topics:
    %ul
      %li What is working well for the class?
      %li What can be imporved for the class?
      %li What we decide to implement going forward?
    The main focus of retrospection is to iteratively improve a team's process, which in this case is our class process.&nbsp;
    It is similar to the survey at the end of the course, except that the students' feedback can be implemented while they are still in the course.
  %li
    Daily Stand Up's and Retrospection's are about the only Agile/Scrum/Extreme-Programming ceremonies that I can think of that can be useful in this classroom scenario.&nbsp;
    If you can think of ways of incorporating other Agile/Scrum/Extreme-Programming ceremonies (e.g. demonstration, sprint/iteration planning &amp; closing) into the course, please let me know and I would be happy to try it out.
  %li
    The course will have 2 phases:
    %ul
      %li Learning and Exercises: this phase is where the instructor will introduce material and the student will practice it with exercise assignments
      %li Project: this phase is where the student will apply all of the topics learned to produce a data driven web application
