  %h2 PostgreSQL Exercises
  %p
    For these exercises, we will play around with PostgreSQL using SQL and Python. People who work primarily with databases (aka database administrators) will normally use SQL, but (web) application developers will normally use an&nbsp;
    %a{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping'} object relational mapping
    &nbsp;library to interact with the PostgreSQL database. ORMs allow developers to work with a database using the application's programming language (e.g. Python in our case).
  %p
    Django's ORM library is the engine/library that allows you and your application to interact with the database thru Django's&nbsp;

    &nbsp;and&nbsp;
    = succeed '. ' do
      %a{href: 'https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_orm/'} QuerySets
    Django's ORM will translate your application Python code into SQL commands that PostgreSQL will understand.

    Follow the PostgreSQL tutorials&nbsp;

  %ul
    %li
      %a{href: 'https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/tutorial-table.html'} create a table
    %li
      %a{href: 'https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/tutorial-populate.html'} add data to a table (aka insert)
    %li
      %a{href: 'https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/tutorial-select.html'} search a table for data (aka query, select)
    %li
      %a{href: 'https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/tutorial-update.html'} update data in a table
    %li
      %a{href: 'https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/tutorial-delete.html'} delete data in a table
    %li
      %a{href: 'https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/tutorial-join.html'} join data across tables
  %p
    You can use the PostgreSQL database in container from this&nbsp;
    %a{href: 'https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/getting-started-with-postgresql-using-docker-compose-34d6b808c47c'} tutorial
    &nbsp;to practice the above commands.

    Our end-goal is to create Django application so it is best to know how to use a database by leveraging the Django framework.&nbsp;

    You can use the Django application from this&nbsp;
    %a{href: 'https://medium.com/@zhao.li/an-example-django-project-in-containers-cc29121df310'} tutorial
    &nbsp;to pratice the above Django model features.&nbsp;
    As a note, Django defaults to using the SQLite3 database if it is not configured to use any particular database, like PostgreSQL.&nbsp;
    But the ORM handles all of that transparently to the developer, so it doesn't really matter which database we're using for this particular exercise as long as we are using the ORM to interact with it.
