  %h2 Where To Go From Here
  %p In this course, you have built a web application using the Django framework and deployed the application on to the Internet using Heroku.
  %p The web application you have built uses an architecture that is a bit outdated. However, it is simplest in terms of learning and getting started. That is the reason why it was chosen.
  %p
    If you enjoyed building a web application, then you can consider splitting up the Django appliation to a separate&nbsp;
    %a{href: 'https://www.gurutechnolabs.com/top-front-end-frameworks/'} frontend application
    &nbsp;(e.g. VueJS, ReactJS, etc.; I've been liking VueJS recently) and a separate backend application (i.e. use Django as just a REST API server).&nbsp;
    Most modern web applications are structured in this manner.&nbsp;
    With a separate backend service (e.g. REST API server), the application can support multiple frontends (e.g. web browser, mobile app, etc.).
  %p
    Most application developers tend to gravitate towards either being a frontend developer or a backend developer.&nbsp;
    If graphics and user interfaces spark joy for you, then look into the frontend ecosystem.&nbsp;
    If data, automation, and the abstract sparks joy for you, then look into the backend ecosystem.&nbsp;
  %p
    If you enjoyed stitching the different containers and services together,&nbsp;
    then you can consider looking into doing more devops&nbsp;
    (e.g. continuous integration and continuous deployment, the service Heroku provides),&nbsp;
    infrastructure (e.g. cloud), or architecture (e.g. microservices, high-level system overview).
  %p
    You can use these&nbsp;
    %a{href: 'https://roadmap.sh/'} roadmaps
    &nbsp;to help you gain a better understanding of the landscape of each specialty (e.g. frontend, backend, devops, etc.).&nbsp;
    You can also use the roadmaps to help guide you to the next topics to learn and explore.&nbsp;
  %p
    Choose what you enjoy and you won't go wrong. If you don't know what you enjoy yet, then try a bit of each and see which one&nbsp; 
    %a{href: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvWs2X-bEA'} sparks joy
    &nbsp;for you.
  %p
    Good luck to you and&nbsp;
