    The basic component of CSS are rule-sets. We define a CSS element using this syntax (https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_syntax.asp):
    <selector> { <declaration>; }
    An example basic CSS rule-set would be this:
      h1 { color: red; }

    CSS selector with id, class, and attribute
    use id for identifying element
    use class for grouping element
    use attribute for extra information on element
